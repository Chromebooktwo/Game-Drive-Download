The Game Drive Zip was made to be put on a USB or a storage device, but if you wish, just download all the stuff inside the zip on you computer and start using the games/time wasting games and nice tools on your device. But if you want to put the files from the Game Drive Zip on a USB or storage device, follow these steps: Download the Game Drive Zip file, then copy the stuff inside on a USB or a storage device, then you can start using the games/time wasting games and nice tools on the USB/storage device or use the USB to easily distribute games/time wasting games and nice tools. More info can be found inside GameDriveInfoPageREADME.html which is inside the zip.
Also, if you see a folder named "__MACOSX", it is not necessary and was created when I transferred the Game Drive Zip file from my iMac to GitHub. For some reason, GitHub zip files from iMac include the "__MACOSX" folder. You can safely delete it if you come across it, it is not required for the Game Drive!
Also, I don't think that I will keep updating this project anymore, even if the games/time wasting games and tools break. I am probably going to do other projects instead, but just like G - Home I will leave this project still up!
